They rode off towards the sunset. Behind them they left a darkening valley.
Behind them was a lake, an enchanted lake, a lake blue and smooth as a polished sapphire.
Behind them were left the boulders littering the shore. And pine trees on the slope.

That was left behind them.
And everything else was in front of them.
